# DGen Gtk

A Linux frontend for the DGen Sega Genesis emulator.  This is still pretty early in development so don't expect too much just yet.  Right now it just shows a list of games from a specific path and lets you launch them in fullscreen.


Want to try it anyway? First install DGen if you haven't already.  Then just make sure that the following directory exists and has ROMS in it before launching Dgen Gtk: $HOME/Games/Genesis


Right now the ROM list is just a simple table, but here is a mockup of the final product:
